# GET_Next_Line

Third project at Hive Helsinki Coding School. The objective is to create a function that reads pre-defined sized chunks from a given file into a buffer
and returns a line read whenever a newline `\n` character is found.

The function is called as many times as needed. So, how hard can it be to read a line from a file descriptor?

## Restrictions:

- One file with maximum 5 functions.
- Each fucntion can have at maximum 25 lines.

## Learnings
1. How to read a file and it's contents line by line.
2. 

## Struggles
1. Handling of the EOF (end of file).
2. 

## Status

- ✅ Successfully completed on **03/02/2022**
- ✅ Scroce: **121/124**
- ✅ Retries:  **1** after 3 peer evaluations. Mistake in header file, ``BUFF_SIZE`` definition had one extra space after the integer.

## GET_Next_Line

Third project at Hive Helsinki Coding School. The objective is to create a function that reads pre-defined sized chunks from a given file into a buffer
and returns a line read whenever newline character is found.

The function is called as many times as needed. So, how hard can it be to read a line from a file descriptor?

### Rules:

- one file with maximum 5 functions
- each fucntion can have at maximum 25 lines
- respect the norm.

## Status

- ✅ Successfully completed on **02/03/2022**
- ✅ Scroce: **121/124**
- ✅ Retries:  **1** after 3 peer evaluations. Mistake in header file, ``BUFF_SIZE`` definition had one extra space after the integer.
